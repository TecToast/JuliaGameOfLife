# Can Julia win the Game of Life?

This repository holds the code and GIFs for my paper `Can Julia win the Game of Life?`, which is part
of the course "Simulationen. die sich lohnen" at the University of Stuttgart.

## How to use the code

After installing the `Plots` package (using `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Plots")` inside the Julia REPL), the user
can simply edit and execute one of the Julia files inside the `code` directory.

## Image sources

The sources for the images in paper/figures are found inside the pdfs in the `output` directory.
