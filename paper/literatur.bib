abstract = {In recent years, cellular automata (CA) models for urban growth simulation have proliferated because of their simplicity, flexibility and intuitiveness, and particularly because of their ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal dimensions of the processes. Though apparently simple, CA models are capable of modeling complex dynamic systems such as urban systems. Currently, one of the main problems in actually applying CA models to urban planning practice is the choice or design of the most suitable CA model. For this reason, a review of urban CA models applied to real-world cases is provided, along with an analysis of their capabilities and limitations. The review and classification of CA models based on the main characteristics of the models has allowed for the analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a discussion of the needs for further research is presented.}

abstract = {Cellular automata are dynamical systems where space, time, and variables are discrete. They are shown on two-dimensional examples to be capable of non-numerical simulations of physics. They are useful for faithful parallel processing of lattice models. At another level, they exhibit behaviours and illustrate concepts that are unmistakably physical, such as non-ergodicity and order parameters, frustration, relaxation to chaos through period doublings, a conspicuous arrow of time in reversible microscopic dynamics, causality and light-cone, and non-separability. In general, they constitute exactly computable models for complex phenomena and large-scale correlations that result from very simple short-range interactions. We study their space, time, and intrinsic symmetries and the corresponding conservation laws, with an emphasis on the conservation of information obeyed by reversible cellular automata.}

abstract = {Chagas disease is a major health concern in South and Central America. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, the only strategy to stop the epidemic is to control the population dynamics of the insect vectors transmitting parasites to humans. From both systems theory and epidemiological point of view, a proper modelling is the first need to develop an efficient control strategy. The purpose of this paper is to develop a spatio-temporal description of the vector population dynamics at the scale of a village. The proposed approach is based on cellular automata, which is a suitable framework to study the spatial spread phenomena. We established the concept of periodic spreadability in spatially distributed systems and use it to investigate the temporal variations of Chagas disease transmission risk in a village of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. This new epidemiological modelling approach provides a desirable tool to evaluate and improve the efficiency of current insecticide spraying strategies as well as to design alternative control strategies.}
