\begin{abstract}
  This paper gives an overview of Conway's Game of Life (and cellular automata in general) and various implementations of it in the Julia programming language.
  It is mostly based on Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code \cite{NOC}.
\end{abstract}


% Introduction -----------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}

\section{Cellular Automata}
\subsection{Understanding cellular automata}
A cellular automaton itself is a model consisting of cell objects, which have a few properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All cells are arranged in a grid (1D, 2D, or even higher dimensions)
  \item Each cell has a state (the simplest case is a boolean state (1 or 0, alive or dead, ...), but it can also be an integer or even a more complex object)
  \item Each cell has a defined neighborhood (typically the cells directly adjacent to it, but it can also be more complex)
\end{itemize}
The last requirement is a function, that takes the neighborhood of a cell and returns the next state of the cell.
Typically, this function is defined by a set of rules, which can be very simple or very complex.
In a 1D cellular automaton, the neighborhood of a cell is typically the cell itself and its two neighbors (left and right).
In this case, there are $2^3=8$ possible configurations of the neighborhood (including the cell itself).
Therefore, the ruleset can be represented by 8 bits, where each bit represents the next state of the cell for a specific configuration of the neighborhood.
These 8 bits can be interpreted as a number in the range $0$ to $255$, which is the so-called \textit{rule number} of the cellular automaton.
\subsection{Graphical representation of 1D cellular automata}
\imagewithwidth{figures/rule90}{\textwidth}{fig:grid1}{Rule 90 (=1011010) visualized as a stack of generations\\Source: \url{https://natureofcode.com/static/ce7e94b17a9690f8b4182e120755263f/2c91d/07_ca_22.webp}}{}
Until now, we have only discussed the theory of cellular automata, but how can we visualize them?
The simplest way is to use a 1D array of cells, where each cell is represented by a pixel.
The state of the cell can be represented by the color of the pixel (e.g., black for alive and white for dead).
This way, we can visualize the state of the cellular automaton at a specific time step.
In a 1D cellular automaton, we can also visualize the history of the cellular automaton by displaying the state of the cellular automaton at each time step in a 2D grid.
This way, we can see how the state of the cellular automaton evolves over time.
An example of such a visualization is shown in \autoref{fig:grid1}.
\subsection{Jump to 2D cellular automata (Game of Life)}
As already mentioned, a cellular automaton can also be defined in a grid of higher dimensions.
The general idea is the same, but the neighborhood of a cell is defined a bit differently, as a cell now has 9 neighbors (the cell itself and the 8 cells surrounding it).
There would be $2^9=512$ possible configurations of the neighborhood, which would lead to a ruleset of 512 bits.
However, this would be quite complex and not very useful.
Instead, most of the time, a 2D cellular automaton is defined by a set of rules that are based on the number of alive neighbors of a cell.
The most famous example of a 2D cellular automaton is \textbf{Conway's Game of Life}, which is defined by the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A cell is born (state=1) if it has exactly 3 alive neighbors.
  \item A cell survives if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbors.
  \item A cell dies (state=0) if it has less than 2 or more than 3 alive neighbors.
  \item A dead cell remains dead if it has less than 3 alive neighbors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Various interesting Game of Life patterns}
There are many interesting patterns (formations of alive cells) in the Game of Life, which can be classified into different categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Still lifes}: These patterns do not change over time.
  \item \textbf{Oscillators}: These patterns change their state periodically.
  \item \textbf{Spaceships}: These patterns move across the grid.
  \item \textbf{Guns}: These patterns produce other patterns.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Implementation of 1D in Julia}
Here I'll also include specific design decisions and discuss the implications of these choices.
\subsection{Implementation of 2D (Game of Life) in Julia}
Here I'll differentiate between simple solutions (like a bool matrix for storing)
and an object-oriented approach which may be even complexer
\subsection{Comparison with other programming languages}
Here I compare the performance with languages, I think I'll choose JavaScript and Python.
I don't think that I'll provide implementations with these languages, rather a brief overview of them.
\section{Discussion}
\section{Conclusions}
Here I will summarize the findings and implications of the research conducted.
